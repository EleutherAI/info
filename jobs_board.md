# Stuff We Need Help With

The #1 thing that we need is people who are competent at implementing deep learning systems. While there is some work for people without that skill set, we are a DL research lab and therefore most of the work involves writing and using neural networks. What follows is organized by *skillset* rather than by project.

## Data Processing

Data processing work involves searching the internet for data, scraping and cleaning data, and writing scripts to load datasets. For an example of what this looks like, check out [the Pile](https://github.com/eleutherai/the-pile).

## Software Development

Software development work involves creating support systems or cleaning up research code and documentation.

### 

### UI/UX

### Web Development and Graphic Design

We sporadically need help with various tasks related to managing our internet presence. Right now [our website](www.eleuther.ai) has the basic functionality we need, but there's always room for improvement.

Post in #website on Discord if you can help.

## Neural Networks

### Basic Competency

### Deep Learning Engineers

### Deep Learning Researchers

Reach out to Stella Biderman or bmk on Discord to talk one-on-one.

## Mathematics

We have a need for theoretical and applied mathematicians to assist with various tasks, predominantly but not exclusively surrounding implementing group equivariant neural networks and doing topological data analysis. We are interested in expanding the more mathematically sophisticated research we do, but we are strongly limited by the number of mathematicians we have.
